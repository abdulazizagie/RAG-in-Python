# ðŸš€ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Python
### ðŸ”¹ What is RAG?
RAG is an AI technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. Instead of relying only on a pre-trained model, RAG first retrieves relevant documents from an external source (like a database or search engine) and then generates responses based on that information.

This makes AI responses more accurate and up-to-date, especially for answering factual or domain-specific questions.

### ðŸ”¹ How RAG Works
Retrieve: Search for relevant documents (e.g., using a vector database like FAISS, ChromaDB, or Elasticsearch).
Augment: Extract useful data from the retrieved documents.
Generate: Use a Large Language Model (LLM) (like GPT-4 or Llama) to generate a response using the retrieved context.

### ðŸ”¹ Why Use RAG?
âœ… Improves Accuracy â€“ Uses real-time, external knowledge.
âœ… Reduces Hallucinations â€“ Limits incorrect AI-generated information.
âœ… Works with Custom Data â€“ Allows retrieval from company-specific or personal datasets.
âœ… Enhances Context Understanding â€“ Provides more relevant responses.

# Summary of the my Code
### This Python script implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using:

- Google Gemini API (google.generativeai) for text generation.
- ChromaDB (langchain_community.vectorstores.Chroma) for vector-based document retrieval.
- Hugging Face Embeddings (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for query embedding.

# Key Components:
1. Signal Handling:
    - Captures Ctrl+C to exit the script gracefully.
2. RAG Pipeline:
    - Retrieves relevant context from a stored vector database (ChromaDB).
    - Generates a prompt using the retrieved context.
    - Uses Gemini API to generate a response.
3. User Interaction:
    - Welcomes the user.
    - Runs an infinite loop to take user queries.
    - Retrieves relevant context, constructs a prompt, and generates an AI response.

# Workflow:
1. Start the chatbot: Prints an introduction using Gemini.
2. User enters a query.
3. Finds relevant context using ChromaDB.
4. Creates a prompt combining query & context.
5. Generates a response using the Gemini model.
6. Repeats until the user exits (Ctrl+C).
